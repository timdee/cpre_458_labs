Listing \ref{lst:HPM} describes our implementation of high performance mode. This code was straightforward due to its similarity with low performance mode.

Listing \ref{lst:DFS_1} describes our implementation of dynamic frequency scaling mode I. This mode varies the frequency range according to according to the CPU load. Lower processor frequencies will conserve power while higher processor frequencies will allow for increased performance. 
Certain CPU loads require that the processor be set to high performance mode or low performance mode. To accomplish this we use the performClick() method attached to the low performance mode and high performance mode buttons. This has the same effect as the user pressing the button which corresponds to these modes.

Listings \ref{lst:DFS_2} and \ref{lst:DFS_2_2} show our implementation of dynamic frequency scaling mode 2. For this mode we though about the phone states which affect the scarcity of power. We determined that the screen state (on or off) and the charging state of the phone were significant enough to be determining factors in how we choose to manage the processor frequency.

In the case of the screen state the following train of logic was applied. If the screen is on, then we are likely to be interacting with an application. If we are interacting with an application than we will certainly benefit from a more responsive device. Therefore we elect to put the phone in a higher power state while the screen is on. We save energy by setting the phone in a lower power state when the screen radio is off.
The decision making for the charging state is straightforward. If the phone is charging then we don't need to worry about power consumption, even if the battery is low.

\subsection{Dynamic Frequency Scaling Mode Mixed}
\begin{lstlisting}[float=*,caption={Dynamic Frequency Scaling Mode Mixed},label={lst:DFS_mixed},numbers=left]
  private void setDFS_Mixed(double cpu_load) {
    // get the battery level
    IntentFilter ifilter = new IntentFilter(Intent.ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED);
    Intent batteryStatus = this.registerReceiver(null, ifilter);

    int level = batteryStatus.getIntExtra(BatteryManager.EXTRA_LEVEL, -1);
    int scale = batteryStatus.getIntExtra(BatteryManager.EXTRA_SCALE, -1);

    float battery_percent = level / (float)scale;

    // get the charging state
    int status = batteryStatus.getIntExtra(BatteryManager.EXTRA_STATUS, -1);
    boolean is_charging = status == BatteryManager.BATTERY_STATUS_CHARGING ||
        status == BatteryManager.BATTERY_STATUS_FULL;

    // determine if we are charging
    if(is_charging){
      // if we are charging we don't care about power usage.... set to high performance mode
      setHighPerformanceMode();
    }else {
      // vary the processor frequency based on the battery level.
      // the higher the battery level, the higher the frequency.
      // anywhere from 100000 khz to 1300000 khz
      double step_size = 1.0/12.0;

      // pretend like the cpu_load is less if the battery percent is lower
      int load_fraction = new Double(Math.ceil( (cpu_load * battery_percent) / step_size)).intValue();

      // load_fraction is at greatest 1
      int high_frequency = 100000 * (Integer.valueOf(load_fraction) + 1);
      int low_frequency = high_frequency;

      Log.d("low_frequency",new Integer(low_frequency).toString());
      Log.d("high_frequency", new Integer(high_frequency).toString());

      // set to fairly high processing state
      DATAname = String.valueOf(low_frequency); // Setting up the minimum frequency at low frequency
      DATAaddress = "/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_min_freq";
      ChangeCPUinfor(CPUname, DATAname, DATAaddress);
      DATAname = String.valueOf(high_frequency); // Setting up the maximum frequency at high frequency
      DATAaddress = "/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq";
      ChangeCPUinfor(CPUname, DATAname, DATAaddress);

      CPUname = "Dynamic Mode";
      DATAname = "current min frequency";
      DATAaddress = "/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_min_freq";
      ReadCPUinfor(CPUname, DATAname, DATAaddress);
      DATAname = "current MAX frequency";
      DATAaddress = "/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq";
      ReadCPUinfor(CPUname, DATAname, DATAaddress);
    }
  }
\end{lstlisting}
Listing \ref{lst:DFS_mixed} shows our implementation of dynamic frequency scaling mode mixed. For this mode we choose to use the charging state, battery charge percent, and cpu load as determining factors in our algorithm. All of these factors have a significant impact on how much we care about our energy usage. In many cases we are willing to sacrifice energy in exchange for performance.

As discussed previously, the charging state impacts our decisions in a straightforward way. If the device is being charged than we do not have to worry about power consumption, and we can activate high performance mode. When the device is not charging set a frequency range as a function of charge percent and cpu load.
We set load fraction to be an integer ranging between 0 and 12 depending on the cpu load. A load fracting of 0.0 yields 100000 Khz processor frequency while a load fraction of 12 yields 1300000 Khz processor frequency. load fraction increases linearly with cpu load and decreases linearly with battery percent.
battery percent causes the program to pretend like the cpu load is smaller than reality.

\subsection{Measuring Computation Time}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Measuring Computation Time - Intense Task Launcher},label={lst:MCT_launcher},numbers=left]
  private long result_factorial;
  private void intense_computation(){
    int computation = 3;

    // do factorial of n recursivly, measure computation time
    long before_time = SystemClock.currentThreadTimeMillis();

    result_factorial=11111l;
    long n = 33;
    for(int i=0;i<50;i++) {
      if(computation == 1) {
        recursive_factorial(n);
      }else if(computation == 2){
        square_big_numbers(n);
      }else {
        fibonacci(n);
      }
    }

    long run_time = SystemClock.currentThreadTimeMillis() - before_time;

    Log.d("Factorial Result", new Long(result_factorial).toString());

    //print the run_time as op message
    OPERATIONmessage2("Run Time" + run_time);
  }
\end{lstlisting}
Listing \ref{lst:MCT_launcher} depicts the code we used to measure computation time under each of the different modes. Depending on the value of the computation variable, the code will run one of three computationally intense functions. These functions constitute each of the loads we tested for computation time. When running the code we had to vary the number of times the for loop ran in order to make the computation time manageable. 
We ran recursive\_factorial() ten million times, square\_big\_numbers() ten million times, and fibonacci() 50 times. Each of these tests took about ten seconds to run.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Measuring Computation Time - Sum of Squares},label={lst:MCT_square_sum},numbers=left]
  private long square_big_numbers(long n){
    if(n <= 1 ){
      return 1;
    }

    return square_big_numbers(n-1) + n^2;
  }
\end{lstlisting}
Listing \ref{lst:MCT_square_sum} depicts a test which computes the sum on the square of all the numbers from 1 to n. This constitutes a significant computation when it is run ten million times.
