 * this class controls the processor panel. The Idea behind this is that

 * 
 * This provides a nice interface for interacting with the gui.
 * 
 * Needs to be able to perform all the functions of the tasks.
 * 
 * Will also update the positions / colors of processor parts.
 * 
 * This will need to run on its own thread.
